## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

* I tried out the Pomodoro technique for Section 3, but found that I either estimated too much time for a segment (EX: part A, exercise 1 etc), or not enough time (Ex: hashes.rb). I think that the act of _trying_ to estimate time for a section of work is a skill I will pick up as I go.  Also, even if I didn't stick to exactly 25 minutes, I found that taking the break was really helpful in keeping me engaged.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

* I applied the Pomodoro technique to section 3 of the project, by skimming the tasks and creating a pom for each segment.  I found that the timer really did help me stay focused, but if I finished a segment early, or took longer I wasn't sure what to do with the rest of my time.  Should I start the next Pom if I finished early? Should I create another Pom if I didn't finish a segment in the allotted 25 minutes?

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

* A hash is an unordered list consisting of key/value pairs.  It's main difference from an array is that it is unordered, and secondarily it can contain unlike things. So the keys do not all need to be integers, or strings but can be a combination of anything.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

`pet_store = {"puppies" => 10, "kittens" => 5, "goldfish" => 200}`


5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

`states["IA"]`

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

`pet_store.keys`
`pet_store.values`

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
* A hash could be used to store customer information such as customer id, name, address, email.  It's better than using an array because all of the data in the hash is for a specific customer, and could be of differing data types.  You could then use an array of say, customer id's, to access different keys in the hash.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
* I had a harder time wrapping my brain around the uses of hashes.  I would love to see more real world examples of how hashes are used, and possibly combined with arrays.
