## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
 * I usually have no problem asking questions, but sometimes struggle with timing.  If I'm in class, I may ask them too soon.  When I'm working on a problem, I may waste too much time searching for an answer before asking for help.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
 * `puts "Hello World!"`

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
 * The hashtag #
4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
 * An integer is a whole number, positive or negative and including zero.  A float is any number with a decimal point

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
```ruby
animal = "zebra"
```

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
 `puts animal`

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
 Interpolation is a way to add strings together, especially if you are using a variable to hold a string. It uses fewer characters to type than straight concatenation

 ex: `puts "A black and white striped horse is called a #{zebra}"`

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
`gets` and `gets.chomp`

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
`.length` is a method to return how many characters a string has, `.split` is a method to split a string into an array at each space in the string, or with a different split character.
